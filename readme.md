emailScript
-----------

This is a script I wrote with the Python API for Selenium WebDriver. I receive a lot of UCSD emails and had several thousand unread since I typically use my primary gmail account. The web client is also very difficult to use. I created this script to easily mark all of my UCSD emails as read.
