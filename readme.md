# emailScript

This is a script I wrote with the Python API for Selenium WebDriver. I receive a lot of UCSD emails and had several thousand unread since I typically use my primary gmail account. The web client is also very difficult to use. I created this script to easily mark all of my UCSD emails as read.

## How to Run

This script can be run by anyone with a UCSD email (hopefully) as long as they have python, selenium webdriver, and Firefox installed. Run the script with these commands:

$ python emailScript.py

You will then be prompted for your UCSD email and password.
